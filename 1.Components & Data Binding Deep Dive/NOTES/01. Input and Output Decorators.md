When we split our app into multiple components, then there are scenarios where we want to share the data between those components.

In our current project, we have two components -> Server Element Component & InputForm component.


# RECEIVING DATA FROM PARENT

We want the Server Element component to "RECEIVE" the Server Element as an input from the App Component.

And for that, we can make use of "PROPERTY BINDING"

YES! Property Binding can be used not just with HTML elements but also with our components. We can have a property in our child component and then, to set its value, we can set it wherever we call that child component using its selector.

But, there is still one thing missing.

Suppose, in Sever Element component, we have a property defined as - 

        element: Element;

And in our App component, we do - 

    <app-server-element 
      *ngFor="let serverElement of serverElements"
      [element]="serverElement"
      > </app-server-element>

While it may look like a correct code, it will still not work and the data will still not be passed from App component to the Child component.

We have to explicitly tell Angular that there is a property in the Server Element component, which receives its value from App component.

And for that, we have the @Input() decorator.

To use the @Input() decorator in a child component class, first import Input and then decorate the property with @Input() - 

    @Input()
    element: Element;


And that's it. Now, since we are using @Input(), Angular expects to get a value for "element" whenever this component is called using its selector. If we don't provide the value, "element" will remain undefined so we will encounter errors in console.

It is not necessary to pass the value to the property with the same name as it is defined in the component.

E.g, we could've written -

         <app-server-element 
      *ngFor="let serverElement of serverElements"
      [xyz]="serverElement"
      > </app-server-element>

But now, we need to explicitly tell Angular what this "xyz" property actually is - 

     @Input('xyz')
    element: Element;


# SENDING DATA TO THE PARENT

We have a second component in our project named - InputForm.

And in this one, we are taking the user inputs and then pushing those values into the serverElements list.

But the issue is, the serverElements list is present in the App Component, not in InputForm.

So, we need some way to tell Angular that when user adds a new Server/Blueprint, then that is pushed to the serverElements list in App component.

So, we want to trigger an event as we add add a new server or a new blueprint.

 And as you might've guessed, we will use "EVENT BINDING" so that as that event occurs, we can then take the data and put it in the list. Just like Property Binding, "Event Binding" can be used on the "events" of the components.

So, how can we create events in the components and then trigger them?

![](2023-06-19-14-31-04.png)

Just like we have @Input() to accept the data from Parent component, we have @Output() to send data to the Parent component.

But this time, we cannot just define a couple of properties. Because, we are not using Property Binding this time. We are using Event Binding. So, we have to create custom events in our component and then use @Output() on them so that we can use those events wherever we call the selector of our child component.

To create custom events in Angular, we can use EventEmitter class.

  @Output()
  serverCreated = new EventEmitter<{serverName: string, serverContent: string}>();

So, we create a new event named "serverCreated" and we define it such that we also tell Angular what type of Object it will emit. We define that the object that it emits has a serverName and a serverContent property.

Now that we have this event created, we can now use it in the selector.

    <app-inputform 
    (serverCreated)="onServerAdded($event)"
    >
    </app-inputform>

The "$event" is used to take whatever is emitted by the event as parameter for the onServerAdded method.

So now the question is, how to emit something from Child?

We want to emit an object as soon as user clicks the button to add a server.

So, suppose, on that button click, we have attached a method named "onAddServer"

Inside that method, we can emit this event as - 

  onAddServer() {
    this.serverCreated.emit({serverName: this.newName, serverContent: this.newContent})
  }

So it means, as soon as user clicks button to add a new server, a new "serverCreated" event is emitted that will emit an object with serverName and serverContent.

And since in App Component, we are already listening to this event on the inputForm component, as soon as this event is emitted, App component calls the onServerAdded() method with "$event" paramters passed to it.

So, we can get that data and then put the new server inside the serverElements list.

    onServerAdded(serverData: {serverName: string, serverContent: string}) {
        this.serverElements.push({
        type: 'server',
        name: serverData.serverName,
        content: serverData.serverContent
        });
    }

And if you remember, this serverElements list is rendered on the UI by looping over it and then using the "ServerElement" component for each server in the list. And this way, we take data from InputForm component and pass data to the ServerElement component.

So, the "App" component is the one that controls all this passing by sitting between the two components because it is the parent of both components.

Also, just like @Input(), we can give a different name to the events as we call them in the app component html. But, in that case, we have to explicitly tell Angular which event to bind that to.

    <app-inputform 
    (someXyzName)="onServerAdded($event)"
    >
    </app-inputform>


    @Output('someXyzName')
    serverCreated = new EventEmitter<{serverName: string, serverContent: string}>();

# CAN WE USE BOTH IN ONE COMPONENT?


YES! We can use both @Input() and @Output() together in a component if we want to.

Suppose there are two buttons in the App Component - One to "Add Server" and other to "Add Blueprint" and we only show a form if user clicks on any of the two buttons.

So as user clicks the button, we also need to pass the information to the InputForm on what type of button was clicked - Was it for Server or Blueprint. And based on that, we may show different type of input forms.

So, in that case, we have to Take the type of button clicked as data from App component. And as the data is entered in input fields and it is submitted, we have to send that data to the App Component back.

So, we will use both @Input() and @Output() in that scenario.


# CAN WE INTERCEPT RECEIVED INPUT?

What if we want to take the input that parent is sending and do some changes and only then use it in the Child? In other words, can we intercept the incoming input? YES.

For that, we can use an Input "property setter" to intercept and act upon the value received from the parent.

Suppose, we want to make sure the Server Element that we get  is not having an empty name and content. If it is, we want to assign a default name to it.

  private _element: Element;

  @Input('serverElement')
    get element (): Element { return this._element };

    set element(element: Element) {
      this._element = element;
      if (!this._element.name) {
        this._element.name = "Default Server Name";
      }

      if (!this._element.content) {
        this._element.content = "Default Server Content";
      }

    }

So, we have a getter that will return the private property we have added in our child when we use "element" anywhere in the template of our child.

And in setter, we are checking if the name or content is empty, then add a default name or content to the server before showing on the screen.

But there is an even better approach than this. That's using the ngOnChanges() hook. Check the other file that talks about the Lifecycle of a Component. In that, ngOnChanges() is explained.
