Whenever we had to conditionally render something previously, we had to use *ngIf directive. 

In our app.component.html, we have a div that we conditionally render based on whether "isApple" is true or false. If it is true, then we render "This is an apple!" otherwise, we render "This is not an apple!"

Here is how we do this using *ngIf -

    <div *ngIf="isApple; else other">
        This is an apple!
    </div>
    <ng-template #other>
        This is not an apple!
    </ng-template>

But, there are some disdvantages of using it.

 - The syntax is not intuitive and very framework-related;
 - Itâ€™s not possible to apply it to groups of elements, to do so you need to wrap the elements inside a container or ng-template/ng-container;
 - You need to import CommonModule or the directive NgIf in your modules.

Let's see how the new control flow solves this.

Now, we have a clean "@if" condition to obtain the same results.

    <div>
        @if (isApple) {
            This is an apple!
        } @else {
            This is not an apple!
        }
    </div>

And we can see how clean the code now is and this is similar to how we write if else statements in javascript or any other programming language.

Being able to provide the content for @else directly is a major simplification compared to the else clause of the legacy *ngIf alternative. The new control flow also makes it possible to have @else if, which historically has been impossible.
