This is probably one of the best updates in control flow in the new Angular versions compared to the traditional *ngFor. Also as per the Angular team, the usage of the new For Loop flow has improvements in rendering times as well.

Let's say we have an array in the .ts file -

    fruits: string[] = ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana', 'Mango'];

Now, using traditional *ngFor, this is how we would show each element in the UI - 

    <ul>
        <li *ngFor="let fruit of fruits"> {{fruit}}</li>
    </ul>

Let's see how the new @for does it - 

    <ul>
        @for (fruit of fruits; track $index) {
            <li>{{fruit}}</li>
        } @empty {
            <p>There are no fruits!</p>
        }
    </ul>

While you may think that the *ngFor code is much smaller, it is also worth noting that the new @for syntax also provides us the @empty section that will handle the case when the list is empty. To do the same thing before, we had to use an NgIf to do it.

This new syntax brings some important changes -

 - Performance improvements up to 90% as compared to ngFor, thanks to the new algorithm used to implement @for.
 - The trackBy function is replaced by the track property which requires providing an expression, easier to write and read than an entire function.
 - The track property is required so that we are not going to forget it, as it happens commonly with the trackBy function.
 - The local variables have now the prefix $ (e.g.: $index)
