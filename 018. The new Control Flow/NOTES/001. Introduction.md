With the Angular 17, we got a new Control Flow syntax that is much cleaner and similar to the control flow syntax in plain javascript/typescript.

This eliminates the need to use the structural directives such as *ngIf, *ngFor and *ngSwitch. 

The *ngIf, *ngFor and *ngSwitch used a directive-based control flow, but now, we have a built-in control flow for templates.
