The ngSwitch has always had a very complicated syntax in Angular and it is not easy to remember. When there are a lot of nested conditions, this can get confusing real quickly.

Let's say we have four buttons, clicking which sets a "fruit" property in the .ts file - 

    <button (click)="selectFruit('Apple')">Apple</button>
    <button (click)="selectFruit('Banana')">Banana</button>
    <button (click)="selectFruit('Mango')">Mango</button>
    <button (click)="selectFruit('Orange')">Orange</button

The component.ts file is -

    fruit: string = '';

    selectFruit(fruit: string) {
        this.fruit = fruit;
    }

Now, traditionally, when we use NgSwitch, this is how we render the content - 

    <div [ngSwitch]="fruit">

        <p *ngSwitchCase="'Apple'">You selected an Apple.</p>
        <p *ngSwitchCase="'Orange'">You selected an Orange.</p>
        <p *ngSwitchCase="'Banana'">You selected an Banana.</p>
        <p *ngSwitchCase="'Mango'">You selected an Mango.</p>
        <p *ngSwitchDefault>Fruit not selected!</p>

    </div>

But, with the new @switch control flow, the code becomes a lot simpler - 

    @switch (fruit) {
        @case ('Apple') { <p> You selected an Apple. </p> }
        @case ('Orange') { <p> You selected an Apple. </p> }
        @case ('Banana') { <p> You selected an Apple. </p> }
        @case ('Mango') { <p> You selected an Apple. </p> }
        @default { <p> Fruit not selected!</p>}
    }


The @switch block replaces ngSwitch with major benefits:

    - It does not require a container element to hold the condition expression or each conditional template;
    - It supports template type-checking, including type narrowing within each branch.
