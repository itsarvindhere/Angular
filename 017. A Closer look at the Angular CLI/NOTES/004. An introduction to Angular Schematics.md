Schematics is a project that was released by the Angular team in 2018. In short, it provides an API that allows you to manipulate files and add new dependencies in Angular projects.

Schematics are like blueprints that certain Angular CLI commands can pick up. For example, we can have schematics for the "ng generate", for "ng add", and for "ng update".

In very basic terms â€” Angular Schematics allow you to modify existing Angular projects, typically for adding or modifying files. Often they are also used to add libraries to your projects but can also be used for much more complex things.

Schematics is a workflow tool for the modern web; it can apply transforms to your project, such as create a new component, or updating your code to fix breaking changes in a dependency. Or maybe you want to add a new configuration option or framework to an existing project.

Angular has some built-in schematics and we can also create our own schematics. Third-party packages can also add custom schematics.
