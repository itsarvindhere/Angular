This command will update the Angular Projects to the latest version.

So, if on any Angular project, you write this command and run it, it will analyze all the dependencies that are inside the package.json file and then it will tell you if anything needs updation.

Ofcourse not every third-party package will be compatible with this "ng update" command. Only those are compatible that support the "ng update" schematic. And again, the "Angular Material" is one such package.

If you head over to this page -> https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/material/schematics

You will see the "ng update" folder there.

So, this means, when we run "ng update", the Angular Material package is also checked by Angular CLI because it supports the "ng update" schematic.

If you want to update specific packages, you can write - 

    ng update @angular/core
    ng update @angular/cli

And so on..
