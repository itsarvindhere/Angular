Alright then. Enough of the theory. Let's just try to provide Services using different ways we discussed and see what it actually means to have same instance and different instances.

# 1. PROVIDING SERVICE IN ROOT MODULE / USING "providedIn: 'root'"

First, we create a Dummy Service file in our app folder. Let's call it the LoggingService.

    @Injectable({
        providedIn: 'root'
    })
    export class LoggingService {
        lastLog !: string;

        printLog(message: string){
            console.log("New Log is -> ", message);
            console.log("Last Log was -> ", this.lastLog);
            this.lastLog = message;
        }
    }

In this Service, we just have one method and one property. The property simply keeps track of what was the last log that we passed to the "printLog" method.

And inside the "printLog" method, whenever a new message is passed, it will be logged to the console along with the previous log and then the previous log is updated.

Note that we are using "providedIn: 'root'" which means now, this service is available application wide and we can use it anywhere in our project, not just in App Module.

So, let's go to the App Component and add this in ngOnInit - 

    ngOnInit() {
        this.loggingService.printLog("Hello from AppComponent ngOnInit");
    }

Similarly, we will go to the ShoppingList component and add this in ngOnInit - 

    ngOnInit(): void {
        this.loggingService.printLog("Hello from ShoppingListComponent ngOnInit");
    }

And now, we run our app and let's see what is printed in the console.

We see that as soon as our application loads, the console will say - 

    New Log is ->  Hello from AppComponent ngOnInit
    Last Log was ->  undefined

And now, if we go to the Shopping List Page, the console says -

    New Log is ->  Hello from ShoppingListComponent ngOnInit
    Last Log was ->  Hello from AppComponent ngOnInit

So, what does this mean? This means that even though ShoppingList component is a part of a different module than the App Module, when the "LoggingService" is used, it uses the same "instance" that was used in the "AppComponent". That's why in the ShoppingList service we are still able to access the old log because that is only possible if we are still using the same instance.

And this proves what we understood in the theory. That is, whenever we provide a Service in the "Root Module" or using "providedIn: 'root'", then the same instance of that service will be available everywhere, no matter which Module, which component, which directive, or which pipe uses that service.

# 2. PROVIDING SERVICE IN EAGERLY LOADED MODULE

So, let's talk about providing Services in Eagerly-Loaded modules, something that should be avoided because as we know by now, providing a Service to the eagerly-loaded module has the same effect as providing it to the Root Module or using the "providedIn: 'root'".

But still, to try it, let's add the "LoggingService" to the providers array of the "ShoppingListModule" and let's also remove lazy loading for the ShoppingListModule since we want it to be an Eagerly Loaded Module for this example.

We can do that by removing the route for "/shopping-list" from the AppRoutingModule which is responsible for lazy loading. And then, we will import the ShoppingListModule in AppModule again, just how we were doing before we added lazy loading.

So, imports array of AppModule should now look like this - 

    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        AppRoutingModule,
        HttpClientModule,
        ShoppingListModule
    ]

Note that since we removed lazy loading for the ShoppingListModule, in the "ShoppingList Routing Module", we need to again add the /shopping-list route instead of the empty ("") route that we added after lazy loading. So, the ShoppingListRoutingModule will now have -

    const routes : Routes = [
        {path: 'shopping-list', component: ShoppingListComponent, title: "Shopping List"},
    ]

And finally, let's "provide" the "LoggingService" inside the "ShoppingListModule".

    providers: [LoggingService]

And now, when you reload the application, the console will show - 

    New Log is ->  Hello from AppComponent ngOnInit
    Last Log was ->  undefined

And if you go to ShoppingList page, it will show - 

    New Log is ->  Hello from ShoppingListComponent ngOnInit
    Last Log was ->  Hello from AppComponent ngOnInit

This means, even if we are providing the LoggingService inside "ShoppingListModule" and even though this is not the Root Module, this service is still available application-wide and so, a single instance is available everywhere. In short, this is the same behavior as the Method #1. 

And that's the reason why this method is not recommended because instead of this, we can provide all those Services that are needed application wide in the root module or using "providedIn: 'root'". This will make the code more readable as well.

BTW another way to provide a Service in a module is using "providedIn: ModuleName". So, instead of adding the "LoggingService" to the providers array of "ShoppingListModule", we can just add this in the "LoggingService" file - 

    @Injectable({
        providedIn: ShoppingListModule
    })
    export class LoggingService {}

This will work in the same way as adding this Service in the "providers" array of "ShoppingListModule".

So, just revert all the changes and make sure to use Method #1 instead of Method #2. Make sure "ShoppingListModule" is again a lazy-loaded module since we converted it to an Eager Module just as an example for this current method.

# 3. PROVIDING SERVICE IN LAZY LOADED MODULE / USING "providedIn: 'any'"

The ShoppingListModule is a lazy-loaded module, and we see that still, it gets the same instance of the service in Method #1.

But, what if we provide the "LoggingService" inside the "ShoppingListModule"? What should happen in that case?

Let's remove the "providedIn" property from the LoggingService and provide it in both AppModule and ShoppingListModule.

So, the LoggingService file should now look like this -

    @Injectable()
    export class LoggingService {
        lastLog !: string;

        printLog(message: string){
            console.log("New Log is -> ", message);
            console.log("Last Log was -> ", this.lastLog);
            this.lastLog = message;
        }
    }

And now, inside AppModule and ShoppingListModule we do this - 

    providers: [LoggingService]

And now, reload the application and see the console.

You will see that initially when the App Loads, this gets printed in console - 

    New Log is ->  Hello from AppComponent ngOnInit
    Last Log was ->  undefined

So, at this point, we already have a new instance of the "LoggingService" which is being used in the App Module.

Now, if we go to ShoppingList page, we see this in the console - 

    New Log is ->  Hello from ShoppingListComponent ngOnInit
    Last Log was ->  undefined

And this means, a separate instance is being used for the ShoppingList Module. And that once again proves what we discussed in previous section.

That is, whenever a "lazy-loaded" module is provided a service in its module.ts file, it will always get a new instance of that service.

And instead of adding the "LoggingService" in AppModule as well as ShoppingListModule, we can also use "providedIn: 'any'"

    @Injectable({
        providedIn: 'any'
    })
    export class LoggingService {
        lastLog !: string;

        printLog(message: string){
            console.log("New Log is -> ", message);
            console.log("Last Log was -> ", this.lastLog);
            this.lastLog = message;
        }
    }

Usign "any" means that all the eager-loaded modules will get the same instance of this service, but each of the lazy loaded modules get a separate instance.

And so, we can remove the LoggingService from providers array of AppModule and ShoppingListModule.

Just note that this method should be used only if you have a specific requirement. Whenever possible, try to use the first method to provide Services.


# AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PROVIDING SERVICES IN SHARED MODULES

Angular highly recommends to avoid providing services using the Shared Modules, even though they are eagerly-loaded. 

As per Angular - 

    While many components share the same service instances, they rely on Angular dependency injection to do this kind of sharing, not the module system.

    Let's suppose there is an Application with a "UserService".

    Several components of the application inject the UserService. There should be only one instance of the UserService in the entire application and only one provider of it.

    UserService is an application-wide singleton. You don't want each module to have its own separate instance. Yet there is a real danger of that happening if the SharedModule provides the UserService.

    Do not specify app-wide singleton providers in a shared module. A lazy-loaded module that imports that shared module makes its own copy of the service.

You may think that since "SharedModule" is an "eagerly-loaded" module, if we provide a Service in this module, the same instance of it should be available application-wide because that's what we saw in Method #2.

But, you also need to think of the fact that the "SharedModule" is imported by various lazy-loaded modules. And this means, whenever a Lazy-Loaded module imports the "SharedModule", it will gets its separate instance of the Service provided by the "SharedModule". And again, this will cause weird bugs in our application if we don't intend to have separate instances of a Service in different modules.

So the botomline is, if we want the same instance of a Service to be available to all modules, that Service should be provided in only the AppModule by either adding it to the "providers" array or using "providedIn: 'root'".
