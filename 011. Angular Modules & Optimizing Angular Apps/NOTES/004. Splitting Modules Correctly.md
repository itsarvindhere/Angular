Now, to fix the error related to "ngForm", we can import the "ReactiveFormsModule" in our RecipesModule because this module from Angular provides all the functionality related to Reactive Forms which we are using in one of our Recipes components.

Similarly, to fix the error related to the router-outlet, we need to import the "RouterModule" in our RecipesModule.

And finally, to have the common Angular features like the NgIf, NgFor etc, we need to import the "CommonModule" as well. 

So now, our Recipes Module looks like this - 

    imports: [
        CommonModule,
        ReactiveFormsModule,
        RouterModule,
        LucideAngularModule.pick({Save, MoveLeft, PlusCircle, Trash2, Pencil, RotateCcw, FilePlus2})
    ],

NOTE - The LucideAngularModule is a third party module for some icons. This is not a built-in functionality by Angular.

So, the core takeaway is that whatever Angular functionality like "Routing", "Forms" etc we use in our Feature Module, we have to import the related Modules in that Feature Module as well. It is not enough to only import them once in the Root AppModule.
