If you look at the `index.html` file in the `src` folder, you will see a line like this:

    <base href="/">

This line is important for the Angular router to work correctly.

The Angular router uses the browser's "history.pushState" for navigation. This is a technique which changes the browser's location and history without triggering a server page request.The router can compose a "natural" URL that is indistinguishable from one that would otherwise require a page load.

The reason why we must have a 'base href' element in the "index.html" of our Angular application is for the "pushState" technique to work. The browser uses the 'base href' value to prefix relative URLs when referencing CSS files, scripts, and images.
