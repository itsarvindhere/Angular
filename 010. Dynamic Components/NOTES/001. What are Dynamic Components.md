Dynamic Components are the components that we create Dynamically at run time.

For example, if we want to show a "Modal" or a "Popup" or an "Alert" and similar UI elements. These should be shown only when certain actions happen like if there is an error or on some button click you want to show some disclaimer to the user and so on.

In Angular 13 and above, this is quite simple but in previous versions, a little bit extra boilerplate code was required.

So, in this section, we will learn how to load components dynamically, how to communicate between them and how to get rid of them when they are no longer needed.
