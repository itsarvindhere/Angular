In Angular 13 and above, there is less code to write when we want to programmatically create, render and clear the components.

The biggest change is that we no longer need to inject the "ComponentFactoryResolver" using the constructor.

And so, instead of first getting the "AlertComponentFactory" and then passing that to the "createComponent" method of the ViewContainerRef, we can directly pass the "AlertComponent" to the ViewContainerRef in Angular 13 and above.

So, now, our code looks like this - 

    private showErrorAlert(errorMessage : string) {

        // Clear Anything that might've been rendered in the ng template
        this.alertComponentContainer.clear();

        // Render the "Alert Component" in the ng template
        const alertCmpRef = this.alertComponentContainer.createComponent(AlertComponent);

        // Pass the errorMessage to the Alert Component
        alertCmpRef.instance.message = errorMessage;

        // Listen to the "close" event emitted by Alert Component
        this.closeSub = alertCmpRef.instance.close.subscribe({
        next: (data : any )=> {
            this.closeSub.unsubscribe();
            this.alertComponentContainer.clear()
        }
        });
    }

So now, there is no need to deal with the ComponentFactory at all.

All that we need now is an Ng Template element in the HTML file, get a "ViewContainerRef" for it using @ViewChild, and then use that ViewContainerRef to clear or create the component programmatically.
