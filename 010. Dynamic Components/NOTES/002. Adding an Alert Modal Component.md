So, we will add a simple "Modal" component that will show an Alert message when the user enters a wrong Login password on the login page. 

Now, there is nothing wrong in how we are handling the errors right now. It's just that to get to know Dynamic Components, we will add this extra Modal that shows up.

Since it is going to be a Dynamic Component, it means it needs its own component files. In other words, we first need to create a component in our project.

We can create it in the "shared" folder.

    ng g c shared/alert

There is nothing fancy in the alert component. It is just a plain HTML modal without using any Bootstrap modal classes. 

So, all that we have is this in the HTML - 

    <div class="backdrop"></div>

    <div class="alert-box">
        <p> {{ message }}</p>
        <div class="alert-box-actions">
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Close</button>
        </div>
    </div>

And in the component.ts file, we have -

    export class AlertComponent {
        @Input() message !: string;
    }

So, we can pass the message to be shown in the modal from outside.

And now, we can use this modal to show the error message on login page as - 

    <app-alert [message]="error" *ngIf="error"></app-alert>

So, it only shows up when there is an error message.

So, the creation part is done. 

Now, the main part is to learn how to load this component dynamically.
