# UNDERSTANDING THE FOLDER STRUCTURE

In every folder, you will find at least two folders - one ending with "start" and the other ending with "final".

I will recommend you to begin with the "start" folder first and as you go over the Notes, keep coding accordingly in that "start" project.

The "final" project in each folder is simply the final version after applying all the concepts of that specific module.
