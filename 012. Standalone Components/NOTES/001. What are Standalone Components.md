Angular introduced "Standalone Components" in version 14.

The main aim of "Standalone Components" is to reduce the need of NgModules in an Angular application.

Note that when we say "Standalone Components", it refers to the Standalone Components, Standalone Directives, and Standalone Pipes.

The basic idea is that the "Standalone Components" do not need to be declared in any NgModule. And if you try to do so, Angular Compiler will report an error.

This means, we can have a whole application that does not have custom Angular Modules at all.

In Angular, it is common practice to import components and services within a module to ensure their availability throughout the module's components . However, this approach can lead to unnecessary dependencies and an increase in bundle size, especially when certain components do not necessitate utilisation of all imported components and services.

This is where standalone components come into the picture as a solution. Standalone components provide a more granular and focused approach to module development in Angular. Rather than importing an entire module with potentially unused components and services, standalone components allow you to create individual components that encapsulate their own functionality and dependencies.

The beauty of standalone components lies in their modular and self-contained nature. Each standalone component is developed independently, with its own set of dependencies and functionality. This isolation allows for better code organisation and maintainability, as each component only has access to the dependencies it explicitly requires.

# BENEFITS OF USING STANDALONE COMPONENTS

By using standalone components, developers have more flexibility and control over their codebase. They can create small, focused components that are easier to understand, test, and maintain. 

Standalone components also promote better organisation of code, as they can be grouped based on their functionality or purpose.

Additionally, standalone components lead to enhanced efficiency and reduced bundle size. Since they are self-contained units, only the necessary dependencies are included in the final build, resulting in a more optimised application.

# UNDERSTANDING THE PROJECT IN THIS SECTION

In this section, we just have a small Angular application with one root module and one shared module.

These are the components in this application - 

    1. App Component
    2. Welcome Component
    3. Details Component

In the "Shared" module, we have one "Analytics" Service and one "Highlight" Directive.

And in the "shared.module.ts" file, all we are doing is declaring the "HighlightDirective" and also "exporting" it. We are exporting it because this Shared Module is then imported in the AppModule and so, this also gives access to the Highlight Directive wherever required.

Another thing to note is how we are using components inside other components.

For example, in "App Component" html, we are using the "Welcome" component.

Inside the "Welcome" component, we are using the "Details Component".

And inside the "Details" component we are using the Highlight Directive and Analytics Service.

So, that's the whole structure of our project when we start. So far, there is no implementation of Standalone Components in this project.
