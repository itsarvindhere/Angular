Before understanding Routing with Standalone Components, there are some new additions to the project.

First, we have two new folders inside app folder named "about" and "dashboard". 

The "about-component.html" has this code - 

    <section>
        <h1>The About Page</h1>
        <p>Just a dummy page...</p>
    </section>


The "dashboard-component.html" has this code - 

    <section>
        <h1>The User Dashboard</h1>
        <p>Just a dummy page...</p>
        <p>Show <a routerLink="today">today's highlights</a>.</p>
    </section>


And inside "dashboard" folder, we have another folder "today". 

The "today.component.html" has this code - 

    <section>
        <h1>Today For You</h1>
        <p>Just a dummy page...</p>
    </section

There are also  "dashboard-routing.module.ts" and "dashboard.module.ts" files in this folder.

Inside the "DashboardRoutingModule", we have this simple code - 

    const routes: Route[] = [
    {
        path: '',
        component: DashboardComponent,
    },
    {
        path: 'today',
        component: TodayComponent
    }
    ];

    @NgModule({
        imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],
        exports: [RouterModule],
    })

    export class DashboardRoutingModule {}

And inside DashboardModule, we have - 

    @NgModule({
        declarations: [DashboardComponent],
        imports: [DashboardRoutingModule]
    })
    export class DashboardModule {}

Finally, we have the AppRoutingModule file with this - 


    const routes: Route[] = [
        {
            path: '',
            component: WelcomeComponent,
        },
        {
            path: 'about',
            component: AboutComponent,
        },
        {
            path: 'dashboard',
            loadChildren: () =>
            import('./dashboard/dashboard-routing.module').then(
                (mod) => mod.DashboardRoutingModule
            ),
        },
    ];

    @NgModule({
        imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
        exports: [RouterModule],
    })
    export class AppRoutingModule {}

Finally, inside app.component.html, we have - 

    <router-outlet></router-outlet>

So, nothing fancy here, just some new components, Routing and Lazy Loading.

In a normal Angular application, this will work just fine when we ng serve.

But, since we are now using standalone components, it will no longer work at the moment. You will see that as soon as we ng serve, the very first issue we get is with the router-outlet tag.

    'router-outlet' is not a known element

Now, if you think about it, this makes sense. Because, we know that to have Routing in our app, we have to use the "RouterModule". We used to import RouterModule in the AppRoutingModule and then use the "forRoot" method an then export it, then import the "AppRoutingModule" inside "AppModule" and so on.

But, now that we don't have any App Module at all, what do we do now?

Well, we know that in a Standalone component, we can import other Standalone Components and Modules.

And as it turns out, from Angular 15 and above, the "RouterOutlet" directive is also a standalone directive. So, we can directly import it inside the AppComponent.

    @Component({
        selector: 'app-root',
        templateUrl: './app.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
        standalone: true,
        imports: [RouterOutlet] <- HERE
    })
    export class AppComponent {}

And now, the error for router-outlet goes away but the new issue now is the blank page with nothing on it. And if we open the console, it has an error. The error says - 

    NullInjectorError: No provider for Router!

And if you think about it, this is not hard to figure out why this is happening.

Because, Angular does not know about the Routes in our application which are inside the "AppRoutingModule".

Now, since we are using Standalone Components, there is no need to have a Routing Module anymore.

All that we need are the Routes. So, instead of an "app.routing.module" file, we will rename it to simply the "routes.ts" file. And all it has is this - 

    export const routes: Route[] = [
        {
            path: '',
            component: WelcomeComponent,
        },
        {
            path: 'about',
            component: AboutComponent,
        },
        {
            path: 'dashboard',
            loadChildren: () =>
            import('./dashboard/dashboard-routing.module').then(
                (mod) => mod.DashboardRoutingModule
            ),
        },
    ];

So, we are simply exporting the routes from this file.

The next step now is to use a method named "provideRouter" in the main.ts file. So, to the "bootstrapApplication", we have a second argument which is an object and this object takes a property named "provider". To it, we will add -

    bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
        providers: [
            provideRouter(routes)
        ]
    });

This method sets up providers necessary to enable Router functionality for the application. It allows to configure a set of routes as well as extra features that should be enabled.

And now, our application will load properly.

Still, the links in header won't be clickable because if you see the App Component's html, we are using "routerLink" directive. So, just like router-outlet, we also need to import the "RouterLink" directive inside App Component.

    @Component({
        selector: 'app-root',
        templateUrl: './app.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
        standalone: true,
        imports: [RouterOutlet, RouterLink]
    })
    export class AppComponent {}

And this fixes the link issue as well.

# WHAT ABOUT FEATURE MODULES?

Well, we see that even though not all the components in our application are standalone, still, everything works just fine. We still have the Dashboard Module and Dashboard Routing Module but that does not cause any issues.

That is the benefit of using standalone components. They can be used with other components that are not standalone with just a little configuration. It is not necessary that all the components have to be converted just to make the application work. 

But ofcourse, if we want to, we can also convert the components inside other Feature Modules to standalone such that there is no "module.ts" file required at all.

So, let's try to convert every component into standalone now. 

So, to the "About", "Dashboard" and "Today" components, we will ad the "standalone: true" in the @Component decorator.

And since "Dashboard" is also declared in the module.ts file, we need to remove it from there since we cannot add a standalone component inside a declaration.

Finally, since inside "dashboard.component.html", we are using the routerLink directive, we need to import it inside Dashboard Component.

    @Component({
        templateUrl: './dashboard.component.html',
        standalone: true,
        imports: [RouterLink]
    })
    export class DashboardComponent {}

And that's one part done.

The next part is to somehow get away from using a Dashboard Routing Module file.

Because we know that the sole purpose of this file is so that we can lazy load the Dashboard Module since we use the "forChild" method of RouterModule.

Well, we can do the same as we did for the "AppRoutingModule" file. That is, just export the "Routes" array from this file, and remove all the other stuff.

So, the dashboard-routing.module.ts file is now changed to "routes.ts" file. And it has just this one export - 


    export const DASHBOARD_ROUTES: Route[] = [
        {
            path: '',
            component: DashboardComponent,
        },
        {
            path: 'today',
            component: TodayComponent
        }
    ];

And now, we can remove the "dashboard.module.ts" file as well.

Now the issue is that so far, we were using the "dashboard.module.ts" file for lazy loading inside app folder's "routes.ts" file by this code - 

    {
        path: 'dashboard',
        loadChildren: () =>
        import('./dashboard/dashboard-routing.module').then(
            (mod) => mod.DashboardRoutingModule
        ),
    },

But now that there is no longer a Dashboard Module file, this routes.ts file will now give us an error that this module cannot be found.

So, now the question is, if we have a separate routes.ts file, how to lazy load the components for the routes inside it? 

Well, that's pretty simple.

We just need to tweak the routes.ts file inside "app" folder to this - 

    {
        path: 'dashboard',
        loadChildren: () =>
        import('./dashboard/routes').then(
            (mod) => mod.DASHBOARD_ROUTES
        ),
    },

So, the "loadChildern" method now supports loading a new set of child routes, without needing to write a lazy loaded NgModule that imports the RouterModule.forChild to declare the routes. 

Note that this works when every route loaded this way is using a standalone component.

This is very important to keep in mind.

Just for proof, lets remove the standalone property from "TodayComponent". And then, when application reloads, try to visit the "Dashboard" route.

You will see that the console has an error that says -

 Invalid configuration of route 'dashboard/today'. The component must be standalone.

And that's the whole point. If you are using "loadChildren" to lazy load child routes without NgModule, then you need to make sure that every component in that child route file is a standalone component. Otherwise, it will not work.

# LAZY LOADING INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS

One very nice feature that standalone components give us is that we can lazy load individual components, without having to wrap them inside an NgModule.

For example, we have the "About" page which is a separate standalone component. And it is loaded on the /about page and we have written this in the routes.ts file - 

    {
        path: 'about',
        component: AboutComponent,
    },

Since we are using "component", the "About" component is loaded eagerly. 

How to make this component load lazily?

To load it lazily, we can use "loadComponent" instead of "component". So, we do - 

      {
        path: 'about',
        loadComponent: () => import('./about/about.component').then(mod => mod.AboutComponent),
      },

And now, the "about" component is also lazy loaded.

You can verify this by using the network tab in the browser. When you click on the "about" link, then it will make a new request for the about component.
