As we know, there are a lot of ways to "Provide" a "Service" in an Angular application.

We can do any of these things - 

    1. Use @Injectable() with {providedIn: 'root'}
    2. Add the Service to the providers array of NgModule
    3. Add the Service to the providers array of a Component
   
Now, we can still do "1" and "3" because even if we use Standalone Components now, it doesn't mean that "1" and "3" won't work anymore.

But what about the way in which we used to provide as service in the providers array of an NgModule? 

Well, we can still do that, just not in any module.ts file. 

Do you remember how we told Angular to bootstrap the application using the App Component when we switched to a standalone component? We use a method "bootstrapApplication" for that.

Well, as it turns out, the method accepts a second argument which is an Object. To this Object, we can add a new property named "providers" which is an array. And this property works exactly how we used to have the "providers" array in the Module file.

    bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
     providers: [AnalyticsService]
    });

And this will now make sure that AnalyticsService is available throughout the application and the same instance is available for every component, directive or pipe to use. Same as @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }).

But still, if you want to make sure a service is available to all the components, the recommended way is @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }).
