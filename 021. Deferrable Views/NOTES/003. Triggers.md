Triggers are simply "instructions" that tell Angular when to load the deferred content. When a '@defer' block is triggered, it replaces placeholder content with lazily loaded content.

There are two types of triggers -

    1. on: specifies a condition for when the @defer block is triggered.
    2. when: accepts a custom conditional expression and loads the deferred content when the condition becomes truthy.

There are some built-in triggers in Angular that we can use. These are -

1. on idle: Loads when the browser is idle; it’s the default trigger for the @defer block.

        @defer {
            <some-large-component />
        } @placeholder {
            <div>Large component placeholder</div>
        }

The above is the same as writing the following -

        @defer (on idle) {
            <some-large-component />
        } @placeholder {
            <div>Large component placeholder</div>
        }

2. on viewport: Loads when the content enters the viewport.

        @defer (on viewport) {
            <some-large-component />
        } @placeholder {
            <div>Large component placeholder</div>
        }

We can also specify some other element to this trigger so that if that element enters the viewport, then load the content inside @defer block. We can use the template reference variables for that.

    <div #greeting>Hello!</div>
    @defer (on viewport(greeting)) {
        <some-large-component />
    }

So now, the content inside the @defer block will be loaded when the "div" with template reference variable "greeting" enters the viewport.

3. on interaction: Loads based on specific user interactions, such as clicks or keydown events.

By default, the "placeholder" is the element that acts as the interaction element. If the user interacts with the placeholder, then the deferred content will be loaded.

    @defer (on interaction) {
        <some-large-component />
    } @placeholder {
        <div>Large component placeholder</div>
    }

But, just like the "on viewport" trigger, we can specify a different element to act as the interaction element.

    <div #greeting>Hello!</div>
    @defer (on interaction(greeting)) {
        <some-large-component />
    }

4. on hover: Triggers when the user hovers over the element.

By default, the "placeholder" is the element that acts as the element on which hover is tracked. If the user hovers over the placeholder, then the deferred content will be loaded.

    defer (on hover) {
        <some-large-component />
    } @placeholder {
        <div>Large component placeholder</div>
    }

But, just like the "on viewport" and "on interaction" triggers, we can specify a different element to act as the element on which "hover" event will be tracked.

        <div #greeting>Hello!</div>
        @defer (on hover(greeting)) {
            <some-large-component />
        }

5. on immediate: Loads the deferred content immediately. This means that the deferred block loads as soon as all other non-deferred content has finished rendering.

        @defer (on immediate) {
            <some-large-component />
        } @placeholder {
            <div>Large component placeholder</div>
        }

6. on timer: Loads after a specified time delay.

        @defer (on timer(500ms)) {
            <some-large-component />
        } @placeholder {
            <div>Large component placeholder</div>
        }

7. when: Specifies a condition as an expression that returns a boolean. 

        @defer (when condition) {
            <some-large-component />
        } @placeholder {
            <div>Large component placeholder</div>
        }

Note that this is a one-time operation– the @defer block does not revert back to the placeholder if the condition changes to a falsy value after becoming truthy.

And this does not end here. We can even combine triggers to create complex loading scenarios. We can specify multiple triggers by separating them using a semicolon and that will be evaluation as an "OR" condition.

----------------------------------------------------------

So, based on our use case, it looks like we can use the "on viewport" trigger to load the "Offer Preview" component when the user scrolls down to it.

So, let's try it -

    @defer (on viewport) {
        <app-offer-preview />
    }

We see an error which says -

    "viewport" trigger with no parameters can only be placed on an @defer that has a @placeholder block.

It looks like we also need a "placeholder" sub-block with this trigger.

And this actually makes sense because if we do not explicitly tell Angular to track when some element enters the viewport, then by default, Angular will try to track the element inside the "placeholder" sub-block. 

But here, we do not have that block at all so that's why, we see the error.

So, let's add the placeholder -

    @defer (on viewport) {
        <app-offer-preview />
    } @placeholder {
        <p> I am a placeholder </p>
    }

And now, the error goes away.

So now, if we open the page, then until we do not scroll down to the "Offer Preview" component, the timer will not start. Only when we scroll down and the component enters the viewport, the timer will start. And that's the way we want it to work.
