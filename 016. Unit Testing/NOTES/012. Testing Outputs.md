Another thing that we are using in our Pagination Component is @Output. And this is a very common thing in components so let's write tests for Outputs.

In our Pagination component, we have an output event that is emitted when we click on any li element that is rendered in the DOM. 

So, it means, we have to store the result of the emission and then check it against some expectation.

    it('should emit a clicked page', () => {
        const pageContainers = fixture.debugElement.queryAll(By.css('[data-testid="page-container"]'));

        let clickedPage: number | undefined;
        component.pageChangeEvent.pipe(first()).subscribe(page => {
            clickedPage = page;
        });

    });

Note that we are using "take(1)" before we subscribe. take(1) will unsubscribe as soon as a value has been emitted.

Now the question is, how can be manually trigger a click element on the li element? Well, we can do that by this line - 

    pageContainers.at(0)?.triggerEventHandler('click');

So, in above line, we are triggering a click event on the first li element which means it should emit "1".

And we can now add our expection at the end.

So, the final test is - 

    it('should emit a clicked page', () => {
        const pageContainers = fixture.debugElement.queryAll(By.css('[data-testid="page-container"]'));

        let clickedPage: number | undefined;
        component.pageChangeEvent.pipe(first()).subscribe(page => {
            clickedPage = page;
        });

        pageContainers.at(0)?.triggerEventHandler('click');

        expect(clickedPage).toEqual(1);

    });

These are just basics of component testing. Here is the official documentation that has a lot of component testing scenarios -
