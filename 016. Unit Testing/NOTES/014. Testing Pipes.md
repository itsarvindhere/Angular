A pipe class has one method, transform, that manipulates the input value into a transformed output value. The transform implementation rarely interacts with the DOM. Most pipes have no dependence on Angular other than the @Pipe metadata and an interface.

We can actually test Pipes without the Angular testing utilities like TestBed, fixture and so on.

In our project, we have a "TitleCasePipe" that capitalizes the first letter of each word.

All it does is take the input string, and if it is empty, return an empty string back.

If it is not, then capitalize the first letter of each word of the string.

Since we are using regular expression, it is worth testing.

    describe('TitleCasePipe', () => { 

        const pipe = new TitleCasePipe();

        it ('transforms "abc" to "Abc"', () => {
            expect(pipe.transform("abc")).toBe("Abc");
        });

        it ('transforms "abc def" to "Abc Def"', () => {
            expect(pipe.transform("abc def")).toBe("Abc Def");
        });

        it ('transforms "" to ""', () => {
            expect(pipe.transform('')).toBe('');
        });

    });

As mentioned in the beginning, you do not actually need Angular's testing utilities to test the pipes. They are pretty straightforward to test.

Also, since the TitleCasePipe is a pure, stateless function so it also doesn't require any BeforeEach.
