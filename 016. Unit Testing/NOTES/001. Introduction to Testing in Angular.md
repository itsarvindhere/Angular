Testing your Angular application helps you check that your application is working as you expect.

There are several reasons for Testing in Angular - 

 - Quality Assurance: Testing ensures that your Angular application behaves as expected. It helps identify bugs, errors, and unexpected behaviors in the codebase, thereby improving the overall quality of the software.
 
 - Regression Testing: As you make changes or add new features to your Angular application, there's a risk of unintentionally breaking existing functionality. Automated testing, particularly unit tests and integration tests, helps catch these regressions before they reach production.
 
 - Maintainability: Well-tested code tends to be more maintainable. Tests serve as documentation for how the code is supposed to behave. They also make it safer to refactor code because you can ensure that existing functionality isn't inadvertently altered.
 
 - Code Confidence: Having a comprehensive suite of tests gives developers confidence in their code changes. When you have tests covering various aspects of your Angular application, you can deploy changes with greater certainty that you haven't introduced new bugs.
 
 - Collaboration: Tests provide a common language for collaboration among developers, testers, and other stakeholders. They define the expected behavior of the application in a tangible and executable form, which helps in communication and understanding across the team.
 
 - Speed and Efficiency: Automated testing, especially unit tests, can significantly speed up the development process. Instead of manually testing every feature or scenario, developers can rely on automated tests to quickly verify that their changes work as expected.


# TYPES OF TESTING

In Angular specifically, there are various types of testing:

 - Unit Testing: Tests individual units of code (such as components, services, and pipes) in isolation from the rest of the application.
  
 - Integration Testing: Tests how different units of code work together. In Angular, this often involves testing components and services together to ensure they interact correctly.
  
 - End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Tests the entire application from the user's perspective, interacting with the application just like a real user would. This type of testing ensures that all parts of the application function correctly together.

# SET UP TESTING

If you open the package.json file of an Angular project that you have generated, you will find one dev dependency named "Jasmine" in that file.

The Angular CLI will download and install everything that you need to test an Angular application with the "Jasmine" Testing Framework.

As the name suggests, this is a Framework for testing the code. It is not Angular-specific. It runs in browsers and in Node.js.

There is another dev dependency in the package.json file named "Karma". "Karma" is a "Test Runner" which, as the name suggests, it is used to execute tests on browsers and other devices and it ensures that the test results are printed out either in the console or a file log. In fact, "Karma" was developed by the Angular team and hence it is the default test runner for apps created with the Angular CLI. Note that "Karma" is not a framework or a platform. It is simply a test runner which runs in its own browser environment.

# INTRODUCING JEST

Well, if you open the official repository of "Karma" -> https://github.com/karma-runner/karma

You will see that it says - 

    Karma is deprecated and is not accepting new features or general bug fixes.

So, ofcourse we should not be relying on a deprecated library right? 

And there are also some other disadvantages of using "Karma". While Karma is a great option for many teams, it leverages a real browser, which can make unit tests heavier and slower than they otherwise should be. Using real browsers also complicates CI systems which need to download and manage browser versions.

So, what is the alternative then?

If you read this official blog post from Angular -> https://blog.angular.io/moving-angular-cli-to-jest-and-web-test-runner-ef85ef69ceca

You will see that it says that in Angular 16, the initial experimental support for "Jest" was added. 

So, what is "Jest"?

"Jest" is a Testing Framework just like "Jasmine", but while with Jasmine + Some test runner like Karma, you run your unit tests in a real instance of chrome or firefox browser, with Jest, you run your tests inside of "js-dom", which is an emulated environment providing what a browser provides (theoretically).
