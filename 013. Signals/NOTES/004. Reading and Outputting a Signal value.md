So, now that we have created a new signal and we are also updating its value properly, the next thing that we have to take care of is to show the value of a signal in the UI.

For this, go back to the first file in the NOTES folder. There, we understood that - 

    To read the value of a Signal, we use its "getter" function which allows Angular to track where this signal is used.

So, it means, instead of simply doing - 

    {{ counter }}

We need to use the "getter" function which will give us the actual value. That is -

    {{ counter() }}

The benefit now is that Angular now knows that since "counter()" is called at this place, whenever the value in signal changes, this part of the application also needs to be updated with that new value.

And this is how signals make the change detection so efficient.
