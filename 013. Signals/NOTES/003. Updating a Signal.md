So, how can we update the value inside the signal now?

When we use signals, we don't update the value by using the assignment operator (=). We cannot do -

    this.counter++ or this.counter = this.counter + 1

Instead, Angular provides us two different ways to update a value in a signal.

    1. Using "set()" method -> Using this method, we can set a new value for the signal

    2. Using "update()" method -> Using this method, we can set a new value based on the old value of the signal. This is preferred for something like a "counter".

So, based on these, the "update" method here best suits for our application because we want to increment or decrement the value of Counter if buttons are clicked. And to do so, we need to know what was the previous value.

So, inside increment(), we can do -

    this.counter.update(prev => prev + 1) ;

So, the update() method gives us access to the previous value and then, we can update our signal to "previousValue + 1".

Similarly, we can do this in decrement() method - 

    this.counter.update(prev => prev - 1) ;

And now, there are no errors in the code.

But, now, when our application loads, we see that instead of seeing the counter value in the browser, we see this - 

    () => { producerAccessed(node); return node.value; }

And that's not surprising since even though we are using the string interpolation, the value inside those curly brackets ({{}}) is no longer a string. It is a signal. So, we cannot directly output it on the browser like this.
