Signals were introduced in Angular 16 so how do Signals affect Change Detection when we are using "OnPush" strategy?

Well, "Signals" work in pair with the change detection strategy. Their purpose is to control when the change detection should trigger.

Signals changes will lead to the component and its children to be checked again, even if that component is using "OnPush" strategy.

In most of the cases, this does not matter much because "Signals" will most of the time change due to some events, and as we know, events are anyways watched by "OnPush" strategy.

But, one situation when it can matter is when you are using a service to share data across components.

To understand it, let's create a new service named "MessagesService" inside the "messages" folder - 

    @Injectable({
        providedIn: 'root'
    })
    export class MessagesService {

        private messages = signal<string[]>([]);
        allMessages = this.messages.asReadonly();

        addMessage(message: string) {
            this.messages.update((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, message]);
        }
    }

So, we simply have a private signal fo the list of messages. And we have a public property named "allMessages" which simply gives us access to the "messages" signal but as a ReadOnly signal.

Then, we have a method that takes a new message and adds it to the list of messages.

So, instead of emitting an event in the "NewMessageComponent" when we add a new message, let's use this service to add a new message to the list - 

    export class NewMessageComponent {
        private messagesService = inject(MessagesService);
        enteredText = signal('');

        get debugOutput() {
            console.log('[NewMessage] "debugOutput" binding re-evaluated.');
            return 'NewMessage Component Debug Output';
        }

        onSubmit() {
            this.messagesService.addMessage(this.enteredText());
            this.enteredText.set('');
        }
    } 

This also means, we can now clean up our "MessagesComponent" HTML to this - 

    <app-new-message/>
    <app-messages-list/>

    <p class="debug-output">{{ debugOutput }}</p>

So, we do not need to pass any input or handle any events from these components as we will use that Service now to share data.

Finally, we can update the "MessagesList" component to this - 

    export class MessagesListComponent {
        private messagesService = inject(MessagesService);
        messages = this.messagesService.allMessages;
        
        get debugOutput() {
            console.log('[MessagesList] "debugOutput" binding re-evaluated.');
            return 'MessagesList Component Debug Output';
        }
    }

Finally, let's ensure that both "NewMessageComponent" and "MessagesListComponent" are both using "OnPush" strategy.

Now, if you run the application, everything will work just as before without any issues. But, what if we are not using Signals?

# USING A SERVICE WITHOUT SIGNALS

Let's now convert our service from using signals to without signals -


    export class MessagesService {

        private messages: string[] = [];
        get allMessages(){
            return [...this.messages];
        }

        addMessage(message: string) {
            this.messages = [...this.messages, message];
        }
    }

And likewise, we will update our "NewMessageComponent" to this - 

    export class NewMessageComponent {
        private messagesService = inject(MessagesService);
        enteredText = '';

        get debugOutput() {
            console.log('[NewMessage] "debugOutput" binding re-evaluated.');
            return 'NewMessage Component Debug Output';
        }

        onSubmit() {
            this.messagesService.addMessage(this.enteredText);
            this.enteredText = '';
        }
    }

And the MessagesListComponent to this -

    export class MessagesListComponent {
        private messagesService = inject(MessagesService);
        get messages() {
            return this.messagesService.allMessages;
        }

        get debugOutput() {
            console.log('[MessagesList] "debugOutput" binding re-evaluated.');
            return 'MessagesList Component Debug Output';
        }
    }

Now, if you run the app and add a new message and save it, you will see that it does not show that newly added message in the "MessagesListComponent". In fact, if you check the browser console, you will see that there is no output for the "MessagesListComponent" as it is not re-evaluated at all by Angular.

That's because we are using "OnPush" strategy in the "MessagesListComponent" which means Angular only checks it again if any Input value changes (which it does not have anymore) or there is some event (which is also not the case).

And so, Angular does not re-evaluate the MessagesListComponent.

So, how can we manually trigger Change Detection? Well, let's see that now.
