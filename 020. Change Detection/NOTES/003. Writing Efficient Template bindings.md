Writing efficient template bindings in Angular ensures better performance, especially in large applications or components with complex UIs. 

# AVOID HEAVY COMPUTATION IN TEMPLATE BINDINGS

As we know, in every change detection cycle, the template bindings are re-evaluation. So, if there are Complex calculations or function calls in templates, then they are executed repeatedly during every change detection cycle.

And that's also the reason why by default, the Pipe transformation values re cached so that the pipe transform function doesn't run again and again on the same input for no reason. And that's why it is recommended to use Pure pipes as much as possible.

# PREFER PROPERTY BINDINGS OVER INTERPOLATION IN HTML ATTRIBUTES

Interpolation in attributes forces Angular to treat them as strings and re-evaluate more often.

For example this is not very efficient - 

    <img src="{{ imageUrl }}" alt="{{ imageAlt }}">

This is a better approach - 

    <img [src]="imageUrl" [alt]="imageAlt">

# DEBOUNCE OR THROTTLE EVENTS IN TEMPLATES

For frequent events like keyup or scroll, debounce the handler to reduce unnecessary updates.

For example, let's say we have a search field where user can type and as the user types, we filter the list. Now, it is not efficient to filter the list on each key press. We can wait for some time and if user does not press any more key in that time, then we will run that logic.

For example - 

    <input (keyup)="onKeyup($event)">

The typescript file will be like this -

    keyupSubject = new Subject<Event>();

    ngOnInit() {
        this.keyupSubject.pipe(debounceTime(300)).subscribe(event => this.processKeyup(event));
    }

    onKeyup(event: Event) {
        this.keyupSubject.next(event);
    }

# AVOID BINDING TO LARGE DATA STRUCTURES

The problem is that Angular performs deep comparisons for change detection so it is better to bind to smaller, specific properties of an object.

For example, this is not very efficient - 

    <div>{{ largeObject }}</div>

This is better - 

    <div>{{ largeObject.property }}</div>

# TRACK LIST ITEMS WITH "trackBy" IN *ngFor 

Without trackBy, Angular re-renders the entire list on every change. So, Use trackBy to identify items by a unique identifier.

Note that, if you are using the new @for syntax in Angular, then you have to use "track" by default. But, this was not mandatory for *ngFor.
