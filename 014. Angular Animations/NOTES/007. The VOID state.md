The "void" state is used to configure the transitions for an element that is entering or leaving the page.

For example, we might have an element with an *ngIf directive so it won't always be present on the DOM. It will only show up when the ngIf condition is True. 

Similarly, we might have an ngFor where we loop over an array and then display maybe a list of elements. So, those are all dynamic elements that only show up when something happens.

We might want to animate things like that.

For example, when we add a new item to a list and show it using ngFor, it animates and appears to fly onto the page from left.

But when we remove an item, it appears to fly out to the right.

And in these types of scenarios, a "void" state comes in handy.

# EXAMPLE

Let's suppose, we have an input box and a button. And as we enter something in this box and hit the button, it adds that string to a list and then we show the items of that list using ngFor.

So, the HTML is like - 

    <label>Item Name </label>
    <input type="text" #inputBox>
    <button (click)="addItem(inputBox.value)"> Add Item</button>

    <ul>
    <li @listItem *ngFor="let item of items; let i=index;">
        {{item}}
        <button (click)="deleteItem(i)">Delete Item</button>
    </li>
    </ul>

And inside the .ts file we have -


    items: string[] = [];
    addItem(name: string) {
        this.items.push(name);
    }

    deleteItem(index: number) {
        this.items.splice(index, 1)
    }

Now, we want to have a nice animation when we add a new item so that the new item appears to slide from the left side.

And since we are using ngFor to show the items, it means they are not initially in the DOM and only when we add them to the list of items, they will show up on the DOM. In other words, they are initially in the "void" state and only when they are added to the DOM, they come to a new state.

So, to define an animation in this case, we can do the following - 

1. First, we define a new trigger - 

    const listItem = trigger('listItem', [])

2. We add this trigger in the animations array - 

    animations: [ listItem ]

3. We define a new transition from "void" state to any state "*" and then define the styles and animation for this state - 

    const listItem = trigger('listItem', [

        transition('void => *', [
            style({
                opacity: 0,
                transform: 'translateX(-100px)'
            }),
            animate("0.1s ease-in", style({
                opacity: 1,
                transform: 'translateX(0)'
            }),)
        ])
    ])

So, here, we did not define any states. Because all we want is to animate when the element comes from "void" state to any other state. So, we can use "void" and wildcard state "*" for that 

        void => *

Inside this, we define the initial style of the element before the animation starts. We set opacity as 0 and the position as 100px on the left side of its final position.

Then, we define the animation which runs for 0.1s and at the end of this animation, the element has opacity 1 and it is placed at its final position.

So basically, we are animating this change in the opacity from 0 to 1 and change in translation from -100px to 0.

And this will show a nice animation when we add a new item.

Similarly, when we delete an item and it is removed from the DOM, we can define an animation for that as well.

    transition('* => void', [
        style({
            opacity: 1,
            transform: 'translateX(0)'
        }),
        animate("0.1s ease-out", style({
            opacity: 0,
            transform: 'translateX(100px)'
        }),)
    ])

There is also no need to define an initial style for this "* => void" transition because we know that an item will by default have opacity 1 and transform value as 0 when item is removed.

So, we can simply write -

    transition(':leave', [
        animate("0.1s ease-out", style({
            opacity: 0,
            transform: 'translateX(100px)'
        }),)
    ])

Finally, let's recall those "Aliases" that we talked about in some on of the previous sections. 

Remember the ":enter" alias? That is simply an alias for "void => enter". Similarly, ":leave" is simply an alias for "* => void".

So, we can use the aliases and write - 

    const listItem = trigger('listItem', [

    transition(':enter', [
        style({
            opacity: 0,
            transform: 'translateX(-100px)'
        }),
        animate("0.1s ease-in", style({
            opacity: 1,
            transform: 'translateX(0)'
        }),)
    ]),

    transition(':leave', [
        animate("0.1s ease-out", style({
            opacity: 0,
            transform: 'translateX(100px)'
        }),)
    ])
    ])
