The first step in using Angular Animations is to import the "BrowserAnimationsModule" inside the app.module.ts file.

This Module is provided by '@angular/platform-browser/animations'.


    import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
    imports: [
        BrowserAnimationsModule
    ],

Okay, what about standalone components? What if we are not using NgModules anymore?

Well, in that case, you have to import the "provideAnimations" function from "@angular/platform-browser/animations" and then add it to the providers list in the bootstrapApplication() function inside main.ts.


    bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
        providers: [
            provideAnimations(),
        ]
    });
