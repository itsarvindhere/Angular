If we want to create an animation with multiple steps run in sequence, we have to use keyframes.

So for example, for the list items that we show, instead of simply having style change from opacity 0 to 1 and translate(-100px) to translate(0), we might want to do something even better.

For example, 


    transition(':enter', [
        animate("4s ease-in", keyframes([
            style({
                opacity: 0,
                transform: 'translateX(-100px)'
            }),

            style({
                transform: 'translateY(-50px)',
                opacity: 0.5,
            }),

            style({
                transform: 'translateY(50px)',
                opacity: 1
            }),

            style({
                transform: 'translateX(0)'
            })
        ]))
  ]),

So here, since our animation takes 4 seconds, and there are four different styles that we have added, it means each second, it will use a style value in the same sequence as we have defined it.

So, in second = 1, it will use this style -


    style({
        opacity: 0,
        transform: 'translateX(-100px)'
    }),

The in second = 2, it will use this style -

    style({
        transform: 'translateY(-50px)',
        opacity: 0.5,
    }),

And so on till it end.

So, this 4 second animation is now further divided into four different styles for each second. This is how we can use Keyframes.


# THE OFFSET

So by default, each style gets the same amount of time. But, we can override this using an "offset". 

An offset defines the point in the animation where each style change occurs. Offsets are relative measures from zero to one, marking the beginning and end of the animation. They should be applied to each of the keyframe steps if used at least once.

Defining offsets for keyframes is optional. If you omit them, evenly spaced offsets are automatically assigned. For example, three keyframes without predefined offsets receive offsets of 0, 0.5, and 1.

It is very important to note that if you add an offset to one style, all the styles in that animate() function require an offset property and a value for it. Otherwise, the app will not work.

So, for above code, we can maybe do something like this -


    transition(':enter', [
        animate("4s ease-in", keyframes([
            style({
                opacity: 0,
                transform: 'translateX(-100px)',
                offset: 0
            }),

            style({
                transform: 'translateY(-50px)',
                opacity: 0.5,
                offset: 0.5
            }),

            style({
                transform: 'translateY(50px)',
                opacity: 1,
                offset: 0.9
            }),

            style({
                transform: 'translateX(0)',
                offset: 1
            })
        ]))
    ])

Since we write keyframes inside an animate() function, it means they are styles applied "during the transition". They are not permanent styles for the element.

And ofcourcse, we can have multipel animate() functions inside a transition() and so, endless possibilities of animations.
