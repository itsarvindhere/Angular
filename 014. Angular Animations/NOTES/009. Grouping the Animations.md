By default, when we add multiple animations() in a single transition() function, then they are all executed one after the other.

This means, that if we have - 

    transition(':leave', [

        animate("0.5s ease-in", style({
            color: 'red'
        }),),

        animate("1s ease-out", style({
            opacity: 0,
            transform: 'translateX(100px)'
        }),)
  ])

Here, we have two animate() functions inside a single transition(). So, by default, the first animate() will run for 1s. And then when it finishes, the second animate() will run.

Sometimes, we want to run them parallely.

And in those cases, we can "GROUP" animations together.

# THE GROUP() FUNCTION

You might want to configure animations that happen in parallel. For example, you might want to animate two CSS properties of the same element but use a different easing function for each one. For this, you can use the animation group() function.

The Group Function takes an array as an input and this is an array of animation() functions that we want to execute parallely.

So, for the above code, we can write - 


    transition(':leave', [
        group([
            animate("0.5s ease-in", style({
                color: 'red'
            }),),
            animate("1s ease-out", style({
                opacity: 0,
                transform: 'translateX(100px)'
            }))
        ])
    ])
