So far we have covered a lot in Routing.

But, one thing that we haven't covered yet, and what's very important, is to handle those routes that don't exist.

For example, what if I go to localhost:4200/something?

In this case, since we don't have any such Route defined, it will not show anything properly on the screen and we will get the error in the console saying "Cannot match any routes".

Ofcourse we cannot manually create such routes because anyone can give any path. localhost:4200/adasdas or localhost:4200/gkjansdjkbnadf etc.

So, how to handle these routes?

Maybe, we want to redirect the user to a "404" page for such routes as that would be the best implementation.

# REDIRECTION

Let's say we have a 404 page component in our app and in our routes, we have one route as - 

    {path: '404', component: PageNotFoundComponent}

So if we go to localhost:4200/404 then this component will get loaded.

Now, Let's say that when the user goes to localhost:4200/something, then he should be redirected to "404" path.

How to do that?

Well, it is pretty simple. In the Routes array, each Route is an object which has properties like "path", "component", "children" etc. One such property is "redirectTo" which will redirect the user to the specified path.

So, we can say -

    {path: 'something', redirectTo: '/404'}

It means, if the user is at localhost:4200/something, then redirect the user to localhost:4200/404 page.


# WILDCARD ROUTES

As mentioned in the beginning, we cannot manually write all the possible routes and redirect them to the 404 page. That is just not a good approach. Instead, what we can do is we can define just one single route which will handle all those routes that are not defined in our routes array.

And that one route which does this is called a "WILDCARD ROUTE".

A wildcard route has a path "**" which simple means to catch all the routes. 

And that's important to understand. This route will handle all the paths, only if there are no routes before it in the array that handle those paths.

And that's also the reason why the wildcard route should always be the last route in the array.

    {path: '**', redirectTo: '/404'}

So now, this route will catch every route that is not defined in the array.

So it can be let's say localhost:4200/servers/asdasdas/adasd/ad/asd/asd

And this will catch it and redirect the user to the 404 page.

If we put this Wildcard Route in the beginning, then it will catch every single route, even though we have that route defined after it.

So, make sure it is the last route in the list.


# WITHOUT REDIRECTION

It is not necessary to redirect the user to 404 page. You can simply show 404 page for the wild card route. In that way, the URL will remain the same but the component shown will be the 404 component. In this way, the user can see and correct the URL if there is any spelling mistake.

    {path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent}
