When we generate a new project with Routing initially, then we will see that Angular adds a new file automatically in the app module named "app-routing.module.ts".

But in previous sections, we added the Routing related data in the app.module.ts file itself. 

So, why Angular adds this extra file?

As per Angular, the best practice is to load and configure the router in a separate, top-level module. 

That's why, the Routing logic is kept separately in an app-routing.module.ts file and then, all we have to do is import this Routing Module inside the App Module.

So, when we add Routing to a project that initially wasn't created with routing, we can follow this practice of separating the routing logic from the app.module.ts file.


    // ROUTES
    const routes: Routes = [
        {path: '', component: HomeComponent},
        {path: 'users', component: UsersComponent},
        {path: 'servers', component: ServerComponent}
    ];

    @NgModule({
    imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
    exports: [RouterModule]
    })
    export class AppRoutingModule { }


So, now that we have separated the logic in the app-routing.module.ts file, we can now import this module inside the app.module.ts file and put in in the imports array.

        imports: [
            BrowserModule,
            FormsModule,
            AppRoutingModule
        ],
