Previously, we could use any Static Website provider like Amazon S3 to deploy the Angular app because in the end we just had to deploy a couple of html and js files. We did not need any hosting provider that could execute code on the server.

But, after we add "SSR", this changes. Because, after we add SSR, we now have some code that must run on the server.

As we saw, an Angular app using SSR is basically a Node.js app using express. So, we can simply search for Node.js hosting providers to find the hosting providers that we can use to deploy our Angular application.

# SOME THINGS TO NOTE

You typically use Angular SSR to pre-render Angular pages on the server. Once the app then runs on the client, it's a normal SPA again.

Server-side rendering (SSR) can make sense because of SEO considerations (crawler should see what your users see) or because you want to deliver a finished page to your users (rather than creating the page in the browser).

But that also has one important implication: You MUST NOT use any browser-only APIs like document.querySelector()  in your Angular code! 

Simply because it will execute on the server and there, such APIs are not available.
