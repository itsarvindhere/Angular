There is one line of code that is commented out in the server.ts file - 

    // Example Express Rest API endpoints
    // server.get('/api/**', (req, res) => { });

With similar lines of codes in this server.ts file, you can actually build a full stack application. And that's a big thing because so far, we have only built single page applications where the entire code executed in the browser.

But now, with the application using SSR, we can execute some code on the server. And so, we can also add a Rest Api to our angular app.

We just need to make sure that the backend routes for the rest api that you create must not clash with the routes for the angular application.

This is a whole different topic and needs some Express knowledge but the bottom line is that, after adding SSR, we can do this as well.
