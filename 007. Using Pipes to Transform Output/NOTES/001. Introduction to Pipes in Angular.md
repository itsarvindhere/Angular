A Pipe in Angular is simple a "function" that we can apply to the expression or value in HTML Template when we add it to the template using string interpolation.

The value on which we are applying the pipe is the input for our pipe function. The value returned from that function will be replaced in place original value.

To understand this, consider this example - 

    {{'John' | uppercase }}

Here, the expression is simply a string "John" and we are using the "uppercase" pipe here which is a built-in pipe in Angular. All that it will do is take "John", convert it to "JOHN" and then that will be shown on the browser.

So basically, we use Pipes to transform the data before showing it on the browser.

There are a lot of built-in pipes Angular offers. Some widely used pipes in Angular are - 

    1. DatePipe - Formats a date value
    2. UpperCasePipe - Transforms the text to all upper case
    3. LowerCasePipe - Transforms the text to all lower case
    4. CurrencyPipe - Transforms a number to a currency string, formatted as per the rules
    5. DecimalPipe - Transforms a number into a string with a decimal point, formatted as per the rules
    6. PercentPipe - Transforms a number of a percentage value string, formatted as per the rules
