One good thing about pipes is that we can combine pipes in Angular.

It means, on one expression, we are not limited to use only one pipe.

As an example, let's say we want to take a date, format it using "date" pipe and also want all the words to be uppercase.

So here, we want to use two different pipes on the same data.

But, we want it to do in a specific order. We first want to get the proper date format, and then on that value we want to use uppercase pipe. 

And that's pretty simple. Just like how we chain functions using a dot (.), we chain pipes using a pipe operator (|).

{{ someDateObject | date : "MMMM dd, yyyy 'at'  hh:mm a" : 'UTC +5:30' | uppercase}}


So, as we can see, on the "someDateObject" input, we first use "date" pipe with a custom format and 'UTC +5:30' time zone. And once we get a value from that pipe, that value is then passed to the "uppercase" pipe which will make every letter uppercase.

In fact, sometimes the order might result in the app breaking.

For example, the uppercase pipe can only act on "String" values. This means, if we pass a "Date" object directly to this pipe, it will break the app.

And so, we cannot do the following if "someDateObject" is not a string -

    {{ someDateObject | uppercase | date : "MMMM dd, yyyy 'at'  hh:mm a" : 'UTC +5:30' }}

So, the order is important.
