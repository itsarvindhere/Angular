So far, we have seen how that last argument in the request methods takes an object where we can set various things like "params", "headers", and "observer".

One more nice thing that we can do with this object is specify the type of response. By Default, we get "json" response but we can specify our own type like if we want it to be a plain text, we can say -

    return this.http.delete(this.url, {
        observe: "events",
        responseType: "text"
        })

Let's say we are getting a file from the request that we made. So, we can set the responseType as "blob" in that case. You can read more about "Blob" here -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob
