So far, we saw how we can make a "GET" request and a "POST" request.

Another very common HTTP Request is a "DELETE" request which, as the name suggests, is used to remove some data from the database.

So, in our project, we have a "Clear Posts" button which simply deletes all the posts from database.

To make it work, we now have to send a "DELETE" request to the server.

And that's pretty simple. 

In the service file, we add a new method to delete the posts which will return the observable, just like "get" call - 

    deletePosts(){
        return this.http.delete(this.url);
    }

And now, in the component.ts, we can say -

    onClearPosts() {
        // Send Http request
        this.postsService.deletePosts().subscribe({
        next: data => {
            this.fetchPosts();
        }
        });
    }

Note that upon deleting all posts, we are making the "fetchPosts" method call again so that the "get" call is made and then we get no Posts and so the UI then does not show any post.

Ofcourse instead of making a get call, we can also just empty the local variable that stores the posts.

    onClearPosts() {
        // Send Http request
        this.postsService.deletePosts().subscribe({
        next: data => {
            this.loadedPosts = [];
        }
        });
    }

And now that we did this in delete call, one thing we can add to our application is to automatically "fetch" posts once we added a new post. So, it means, we need to tweak the service file so that in createPost method, we just return the observable.

    // Create a new Post
    createPost(post : Post) {
        return this.http.post<{name: string}>(this.url, post);
    }

And now, in the component, we can say -

    onCreatePost(post: Post) {
        // Send Http request
        this.postsService.createPost(post).subscribe({
        next: data => {
            this.fetchPosts();
        }
        });
    }

So, you can see that as soon as we get a response that is not an error, we simply call fetchPosts which will make a get call and then we will also see the newly added post appearing on the UI automatically.
