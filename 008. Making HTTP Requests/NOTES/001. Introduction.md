Almost all the front-end applications need to communicate with a server over a protocal called "HTTP" to get or send data and to access other back-end services.

In a plain Javascript web application that does not use any framework like Angular, we typically use the "Fetch" API to make API calls. For an even cleaner code, we can use third-party libraries like "Axios".

In Angular, we can use a built-in "HttpClient" Service to communcate to backend services using the HTTP protocol. The "HTTPService" is provided by "@angular/common".

# THE ANATOMY OF AN HTTP REQUEST

The most important part of an HTTP Request is the URL which is also called the "API Endpoint".

And when it comes to REST APIs, it is not just about the URL but also about the "METHOD" which is one of "GET", "POST" ,"PUT" etc.

"GET" is used when you want to fetch some data from the server.
"POST" is used when you want to send some data to the server.
"PUT" is used when you want to update some data on the server.

And there are more HTTP Methods available such as - HEAD, DELETE, PATCH, and OPTIONS.

Sometimes, we also need to set additional metadata in an HTTP request which are known as the "HEADERS" of a request. 

And Finally, for some HTTP Requests, we also pass the "BODY" which is basically the data that we want to send some data to the server. For example, in a "POST" , "PUT" or "PATCH" request.
