So, now that we understand what HTTP Headers are, how can we set them using the HTTPClient when we make some HTTP request?

On Any HTTPClient method like get(), post() or delete(), we can pass the last argument as a JavaScript Object which takes different properties and one property is "headers".

And this is the property through which we can pass headers in any Http request. This property takes an object of type "HttpHeaders" which you import from '@angular/common/http'

And using it is pretty simple. We just need to pass an Object to it where key is the name of the header and the value is its value.

    return this.http.get<{[key: string]: Post}>(this.url, {
        headers: new HttpHeaders({
            "Some-Header": 'Some Value'
        })
    })

And note that we are passing this header when we make a request to the server. This means, it is a "Request Header".

And that's why, in the Browser, you can see in the Headers tab that it appears under the "Request Headers".

One thing to note is that "Spaces" are not allowed in Header names. So, you cannot have a header named "Some Header". If you do this, the call doesn't even get made. Make sure you check that.
