While so far we are able to fetch posts and add new posts, it is not the recommended approach.

All our HTTP Calls are residing inside the component.ts file but Angular recommends to limit logic in a component to only that is required for the view. All other logic should be delegated to services.

So, we should have a separate service that does have the logic for all the HTTP Requests so that all that we have to do is to subscribe in component.ts file.

So, let's create a new Service named "posts".

    ng g s posts

And so now, in this PostsService, we have keep the methods to fetch posts and to add a new post to the database.


    // Create a new Post
    createPost(post : Post) {
        return this.http.post<{name: string}>(this.url, post).subscribe({
        next: data => {
            console.log("New Post Created",data);
        }
        });
    }

    // Fetch Posts
    fetchPosts(){
        this.http.get<{[key: string]: Post}>(this.url)
        .pipe(map((response) =>{
        let list: Post[] = []
        for(const key in response) {
            list.push({...response[key], id: key})
        }
        return list
        }))
        .subscribe({
        next: (posts) => {
            console.log("Posts",posts);
        }
        })
    }


But now, while we have moved the requests to service file, the issue is that the link between Template and Component is now broken. We have to somehow get the posts that "get" request gives us in the service, in the Component itself. 

One way can be to use a Subject in the service file. So as we get the data, we can then do subject.next with that data and in the component we can subscribe to that subject.

But, while this approach is not bad, it is important to know when to use Subjects. We normally use them when multiple components require the same data. But here, we just have one app component that needs it so a Subject might be an overkill here.

Instead, what we can do is, we can keep the "subscribe" logic in component itself. So, basically, in the service, we will just return the observable which we get from the "get()" method and in the component, we can then subscribe to it.

    // Fetch Posts
    fetchPosts(){
        return this.http.get<{[key: string]: Post}>(this.url)
        .pipe(map((response) =>{
        let list: Post[] = []
        for(const key in response) {
            list.push({...response[key], id: key})
        }
        return list
        }));
    }

And now, in the component.ts file, we can do -

    private fetchPosts() {
        this.postsService.fetchPosts()
        .subscribe({
        next: (posts) => {
            this.loadedPosts = posts;
            this.isFetching = false;
        }
        })
    }

So basically, we just prepare the observable in service file and then we subscribe to it in component file.
