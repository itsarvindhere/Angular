Now that we have created and saved the User Data upon successful authentication, it would be better if we now tweak the UI a bit so that the user now sees a "Logout" button in the header.

We will also show the "Manage" dropdown only if user is logged in.

The first thing, however, is to Navigate the user away from "Login/Signup" page to some other page in our app because User is now logged in.

So, let's say we want to navigate the user to /recipes route when the login or signup is successful. In that case, inside auth.component.ts, we just need to do -

    request.subscribe({
            next: data => {
                this.requestInProgress = false;
                console.log("Data is", data)

                // Navigate the User to the '/recipes' page
                this.router.navigate(['/recipes']);

            },
    })

Don't forget to inject "Router" inside the constructor.

Next, we can show or hide the links in the header based on whether user is logged in or not.

So, in the Header Component, we need to know if the user is logged in. And that we can know using our "User" subject.

    isLoggedIn = false;
    ngOnInit(): void {
        this.userSub = this.authService.user.subscribe({
            next: data => {
            if (data.token) this.isLoggedIn = true;
            }
        })
    }

And now, in the HTML, based on this "isLoggedIn" flag, we can show or hide the links in the header.
