At this point it makes sense to also add a "Logout" button that will let us log the user out.

This is super simple because to log the users out, we don't even need to make any HTTP request to Firebase.

That's because, we know that as long as we have the User object which has a valid token, that user is logged in.

But, if that user object itself is null, then that simply means the user is not authenticated. So, to log users out, we can simply emit "null" using the BehaviorSubject.


    logout(){
        this.user.next(null);

        // Redirect to the /auth page
        this.router.navigate(['/auth']);
    }

And ofcourse if the user has logged out, it makes sense to redirect the user to the login page again.
