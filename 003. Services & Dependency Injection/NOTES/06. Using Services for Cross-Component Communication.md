Using services make us write lesser code to communicate between components.

In our current project, we have this structure - 

    Parent -> app.component.ts
        Child1 -> new-account.component.ts
        Child2 -> account.component.ts

Suppose, when we click a button in child2, we want to output something in child1. 

If we don't use services, we would have to emit an event from child2, then handle that event in parent, then take the data emitted by the event, and then pass that data to the child1. That's pretty complicated.

But, using a service, it is super simple to do.

We can create an event emitter in the service file itself.

In the accounts.service.ts, we will write - 

    statusUpdated = new EventEmitter<string>();

And now, when we update the status of an account by clicking the button, we can then emit this event with the status - 

In the account.component.ts, we write - 

    onSetTo(status: string) {
        this.accountsService.updateStatus(this.id, status);
        this.accountsService.statusUpdated.emit(status);
    }

And, in the new-account.component.ts, we can then subscribe to this event - 

    ngOnInit(): void {
    this.accountsService.statusUpdated.subscribe(data => {
      alert("New Status -> " + data);
    })
  }

So, using a service eliminates the need to emit an event, handle it in parent, and then pass the data from parent to child.
