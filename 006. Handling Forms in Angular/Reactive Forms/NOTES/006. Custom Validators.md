Just like in Template-driven Forms, we can add our custom validators in Reactive Forms. And to make everything simple, let's take the same example as we did in Template-driven forms. 

So, we want to make sure the user cannot enter a username that is "admin" or "sudo".

In the Template-driven Forms, we had to create a new Directive, then we had to implement the "Validator" interface and then we had to implement the "validate" method inside it. 

But, in Reactive forms, the process is a bit simpler.

We just need to create a new function that does the validation and then use that function in our Form. We create a function that returns a "ValidatorFn". In fact, if you hover over the names of the built-in validators in Angular like "required", you will see that it is also has a type as "ValidatorFn". This is the definition of the "ValidatorFn" interface - 

    (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null;

So, it is a function which accepts a form control and then returns either an object of type "ValidationErrors" or "null".

So, we can create a function that returns "ValidatorFn" -

    forbiddenNameValidator(): ValidatorFn {
        const forbiddenNames = ['admin', 'sudo'];
        return (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors => {
            if (forbiddenNames.includes(control.value)){
                return { 
                "forbiddenName": true, 
                "notAllowed": control.value
                }
            };

            return null;
        }
    }

Here, "forbiddenNameValidator" is not the validator itself. It is the "Validator Creation Function" so it returns a validator. The benefit is that we can pass any argument to this "forbiddenNameValidator" from outside which we can then use inside the actual validator function. This is not possible if you directly write a function of type "ValidatorFn" because it accepts only one argument which is the "AbstractControl". Just imagine if we need to pass the list of forbidden names from outside dynamically. That is why we follow this "Validator Creation Function" in most of the cases. Yes, we can directly create a "ValidatorFn" as well but it is always better to have a "Validator Creation Function" instead.

Now, to add this validator to the username field, we can simply call the "forbiddenNameValidator" inside the "validators" array of the Form Control -

    username: new FormControl('', {
        validators: [Validators.required, this.forbiddenNameValidator()]
    }),

Remember that we are calling the "Validator Creation Function", not the actual validator that it returns. So, do not get confused on why we did not write "Validators.required()" but we are writing "this.forbiddenNameValidator()". "Validators.required" is a "ValidatorFn" itself but only the call to "this.forbiddenNameValidator()" will return a "ValidatorFn".

To make the code better, we can create a new class just to keep all these custom validators, just like how Angular has kept its built-in validators inside the "Validators" class. So, let's create a new file named "custom-validators.ts" and in it, we can have -

export class CustomValidators {

    export class CustomValidators {

        public static forbiddenNameValidator(): ValidatorFn {
            const forbiddenNames = ['admin', 'sudo'];
            return (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors => {
            if (forbiddenNames.includes(control.value)){
                return { 
                    "forbiddenName": true, 
                    "notAllowed": control.value
                }
            };
                return null;
            }
        } 
    }

And now, we can use this function - 

    username: new FormControl('', {
        validators: [Validators.required, CustomValidators.forbiddenNameValidator()]
    }),

Now, we have made this Validator Function reusable so it is no longer tied to a specific component only. We can call it from any other component where we need it. So, let's say for our App Component, we need to define some forbidden names and then pass them to this custom validator function. We can do that easily. Our function will become -

    public static forbiddenNameValidator(forbiddenNames: string[]): ValidatorFn {
        return (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors => {
          if (forbiddenNames.includes(control.value)){
            return { 
              "forbiddenName": true, 
              "notAllowed": control.value
            }
          };
          return null;
        }
    } 

And from our App Component, we can prvovide an array as an argument - 

    CustomValidators.forbiddenNameValidator(["admin", "sudo"])

This is the benefit of using a "Validator Creation Function", instead of directly having a "ValidatorFn".

# SHOWING ERROR MESSAGES BASED ON DIFFERENT VALIDATORS

Now that we have two different validators on username field, let us show two different error messages.

    <p
        class="text-danger"
        *ngIf="signupForm.get('userData.username').invalid && signupForm.get('userData.username').touched"
    >
        <!-- REQUIRED VALIDATION FAILS -->
        <span *ngIf="signupForm.get('userData.username').errors?.['required']"> Username cannot be empty!</span>
            
        <!-- FORBIDDEN NAME VALIDATION FAILS -->
        <span *ngIf="signupForm.get('userData.username').errors?.['forbiddenName']">
            Username {{signupForm.get('userData.username').errors?.['notAllowed']}} is not allowed!
        </span>
    </p>

You can see how we use the "forbiddenName" and "notAllowed" keys we returned when the forbiddenName validation failed.
