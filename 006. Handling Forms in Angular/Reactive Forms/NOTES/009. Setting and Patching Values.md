The last piece of the puzzle is to learn how we can set or patch values in the form like how we did in Template-driven approach.

The approach is same in Reactive Forms because we have a "setValue" method available on the FormGroup. And this method expects you to pass an object with each form control or form group or form Array name as the key and its value that you want to give.

    this.signupForm.setValue({
      userData: {
        username: "John",
        email: "test@gmail.com"
      },
      gender: 'male',
      hobbies: []
    })

If we want to set a value for a specific form control only, we can use patchValue method.

    this.signupForm.patchValue({
      userData: {
        email: "test@gmail.com"
      }
    })

And finally, to reset the form, we have the "reset" method available on the FormGroup.

    this.signupForm.reset()

Note that this will reset the values which means if in ngOnInit you have given a default value to some field, that will also get reset, for example the gender radio buttons in our case.

So if you want to preserve that, just pass an object to the reset method with all the values you want to set to some default value after form is reset.

    this.signupForm.reset({
      gender: 'male'
    });
