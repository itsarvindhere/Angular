In the previous section, we created a custom validator that will check if the username is valid or not.

But, in real-world applications, we do not know beforehand what are the valid usernames and what are the invalid ones.

For example, we might want to restrict the user from choosing a username that is already taken by someone else. You might have seen this feature in almost every social media app where a username needs to be a unique name that no one else has.

And so, when a user enters something, an API call has to be made to fetch all the registered usernames and check if there is already a username present in the data base which is same as the one that user entered.

This is an asynchronous operation and takes some time. And so, if we have to create such a validator for our username field, we have to create a "Custom Asynchronous Validator".

These validators wait for the api response before returning error objects.

Let's create one in our project.

We will make sure email is something that is not already present in the database. Since we don't have any such database yet, we will just hardcode the email that is already taken and cannot be chosen again. Again, we can create a new async validator inside the "CustomValidators" class that we created previously -

    public static forbiddenEmailValidator(): AsyncValidatorFn {
        return (control: AbstractControl): Observable<ValidationErrors | null> => {
            return of(control.value).pipe(
                map(val => val === 'test@test.com' ? {'forbiddenEmail' : true} : null), 
                delay(1500)
            )
        }
    }

Notice how here, instead of returning a "ValidatorFn", we are returning an "AsyncValidatorFn". This is to let Angular know that this is an Async Validator, not a synchronous one. This is how the "AsyncValidatorFn" is defined - 

    (control: AbstractControl): Promise<ValidationErrors | null> | Observable<ValidationErrors | null>;

So, it takes a type of "AbstractControl" as input and returns either a "Promise" or "Observable". In our case, we are returning an Observable.

Inside this validator, we are using delay(1500) so that we mimic the behaviour of an actual api call that will take a couple of seconds to return some response. When 1.5 seconds pass, we will compare the value in email field to the hard coded value 'test@test.com'. If there is a match, it means, this email is already chosen so we will use "next" method to emit an object with 'forbiddenEmail' as the key and "true" as the value.

Now, to show an error message to the user when email is forbiddne, we just do the same as we did for other validators - 

    <span *ngIf="signupForm.get('userData.email').errors?.['forbiddenEmail']">
        Email is already taken. Pleae enter a different email!
    </span>

So, this is how simple it is to create Async validators in Reactive Forms in Angular.
