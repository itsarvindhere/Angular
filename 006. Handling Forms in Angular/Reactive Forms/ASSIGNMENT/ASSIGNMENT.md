In this small assignment, we can revise the things that we learnt about Reactive Forms so far.

In this assignment, we have to create a form with the following controls and validators.

  - Project Name (should not be empty)
  - Email (Should not be empty and should be a valid email)
  - Project Status Dropdown with three values : 'Stable', 'Critical' and 'Finished'
  - Submit Button

Add a custom validator so that "Test" cannot be a Project name.

When form is submitted, simply print the value to the console.
