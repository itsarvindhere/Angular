This is an assignment that you can use to test your knowledge of the Template Driven Forms.

The file "forms-td-assignment-final" is the final version of this assignment with the solution.

Use the "start" version to try on your own.

In this assignment you are asked to build a form which has the following fields - 

1. Email Address (required and should be a valid email address format)
2. Dropdown with three options - Basic, Advanced, Pro (Advanced should be the default selected one)
3. Password Field (required)

There should be a submit button.

If an input is invalid, display a warning message below it.

If the form is invalid and was touched, display a warning message.

Finally, upon submitting the form, you should simply print the value of form to console log. You can also try to display it on the UI if you want.
