As we know, @ViewChild lets us access an element from the template in the typescript code.

And since in our code, we do have a reference variable on the form element, we can use ViewChild as well which gives us another way to handle form submission.

    <form #f="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">


    @ViewChild('f')
    signupForm: NgForm;

    onSubmit() {
      console.log(this.signupForm);
    }

You may think what is the advantage of this method? Well, just imagine if for some reason, we want access to this form object before we submit the form. So, we don't only want it when we click the submit button. We want it before that as well.

In that case, the previous approach won't work because in that approach, we get the form only when we click submit. But here, the form object will be available to us as soon as the View is initialized. (Remember ngAfterViewInit? )

So, it depends on how you want to use the form object. If you just want it when submit is clicked, then we can simply pass it as argument of NgSubmit method. Otherwise, if we want it before the submission, we can use the @ViewChild method.
