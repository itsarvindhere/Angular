Now that we know how to access form data, let's add a functionality where we output the data upon submit on the same page below the submit button.

For that, we will create a "user" object that has different fields that we will set to the form control values when we submit.

Let's also create a variable to track if form has been submitted.

    submitted = false;
    user = {
        username: '',
        email: '',
        gender: '',
        secretQuestion: '',
        answer: ''
    }

Note that the keys don't necessarily need to have same names as form control names since we are going to use it just to store the values and output them on the page.

And now, when we submit, we can fill this object with data.

    onSubmit() {
      this.submitted = true;
      this.user.username = this.signupForm.value.userData.username;
      this.user.email = this.signupForm.value.userData.email;
      this.user.gender = this.signupForm.value.userData.gender;
      this.user.secretQuestion = this.signupForm.value.secret;
      this.user.answer = this.signupForm.value.questionAnswer;
    }

In our html, we have - 

    <div class="row" *ngIf="submitted">
        <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h3>Your Data</h3>
        <p>Username: {{user.username}}</p>
        <p>Mail: {{user.email}}</p>
        <p>Gender: {{user.gender}}</p>
        <p>Secret Question: {{user.secretQuestion}}</p>
        <p>Answer: {{user.answer}}</p>
        </div>
    </div>

And that's pretty much it. Now, when we submit, the data will show up on the page.
