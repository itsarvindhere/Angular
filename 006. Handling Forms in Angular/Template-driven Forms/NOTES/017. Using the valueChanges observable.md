Let's say that we have a requirement that we want to save the user's inputs in the form so that when the page reloads, those values are pre-populated in the form.

So, the first step to this is to take the user inputs and save them somewhere, maybe in the browser's local storage. For that, we need to know when the form values update and to listen to those changes, we have an observable that we can subscribe to named "valueChanges". This is provided by the "NgForm" directive.

We also want to do this when the form has been rendered on the browser completely so it's time to use the newly introduced lifecycle hooks in Angular - afterRender and afterNextRender.

We will use "afterNextRender" here as we do not want to run the code on each render.

    constructor() {
        afterNextRender(() => {
            this.signupForm.valueChanges.subscribe({
                next: (data) => {
                    window.localStorage.setItem('form-data', JSON.stringify(data));
                }
            })
        })
    }

So, what did we do here?

Well, we are listening to the "valueChanges" observable and when it emits any event, we will take the object that has the value for each form control, and then we will save that value in the local storage.

Now, the issue here is that "valueChanges" is fired on each change which means on each keystroke as well. This is not that efficient. We can wait for some time before we subscribe to the observable and that we can do using "debounceTime" operator.

    constructor() {
        afterNextRender(() => {
            this.signupForm.valueChanges
                .pipe(debounceTime(500))
                .subscribe({
                next: (data) => {
                    window.localStorage.setItem('form-data', JSON.stringify(data));
                }
            })
        })
    }

We also need to make sure we are unsubscribing to this subscription when the component gets destroyed. We can use "DestroyRef" here - 

    destroyRef = inject(DestroyRef);

    constructor() {
        afterNextRender(() => {
            const valueChangesSubscription = this.signupForm.valueChanges
                .pipe(debounceTime(500))
                .subscribe({
                next: (data) => {
                    window.localStorage.setItem('form-data', JSON.stringify(data));
                }
            })

            this.destroyRef.onDestroy(() => valueChangesSubscription.unsubscribe());
    })

And that's it. We are done with the first requirement which was to save the entered data somewhere even if we reload the page.

The next step is to ensure when the page loads, if the user had some data in the form previously, we populate that in the form. We do that in the afterNextRender() hook as well - 

    afterNextRender(() => {
        const formData = window.localStorage.getItem('form-data');
        if (formData) {
          this.signupForm?.setValue(JSON.parse(formData));
        }
    ...
    })

While this should theoretically work, you will see an error in the console that says -

    There are no form controls registered with this group yet. If you're using ngModel,
    you may want to check next tick (e.g. use setTimeout).
  
This is one thing with Template Driven Forms. The form controls will not get registered on the initialization of the component. So, as the error suggests, we should be using a "setTimeout" here -

    afterNextRender(() => {
        const formData = window.localStorage.getItem('form-data');
        if (formData) {
          setTimeout(() => this.signupForm?.setValue(JSON.parse(formData)));
        }
    ...
    })

setTimeout() will trigger a change detection cycle. This is not the most elegant solution to this problem but we will see a better solution in case of Reactive Forms.

BTW, we could've also used the "ngAfterViewInit" hook instead of "afterNextRender" and that would've worked too.
