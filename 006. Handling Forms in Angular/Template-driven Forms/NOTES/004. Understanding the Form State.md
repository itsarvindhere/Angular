Let's dive a bit deeper in the Form object that we get when we assign NgForm to a variable.

We already saw the "value" property in this object which has key-value pairs with "key" being the form control name and the "value" being its current value.

There is also a property named "controls" which is also an object and when we expand it, we see that it has all the form controls in our form and their value is an object of type "FormControl". And each form control object has all the details of a form along with the state of the form.

For example, we have "status", "errors", "touched", "pristine", "value" and so on. 

There are many properties that are in FormControl object which are also present for the overall form.

For example, "dirty", which is used to check if the form controls have been changed or not.

If we reload the page and submit the form without even clicking any form control, we will see that the "dirty" field remains "false".

Note that "dirty" only changes if we "change" the value in any form. If we just click it, then it won't change. For that, we have another property "touched" which, as the name suggests, tells if  form or form control has been clicked.

There are two properties named "valid" and "invalid" and these two are also present for the individual controls. If form or the form control has any invalid data, then "invalid" will be true and "valid" will be false. But this is something we will understand later when we add form validation.
