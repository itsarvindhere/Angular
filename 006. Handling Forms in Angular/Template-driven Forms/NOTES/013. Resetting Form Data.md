The last part to know in Template Driven Forms is how to reset the form values. Or in other words, make the form empty as it looks like when the page is loaded for the first time or reloaded.

One way would be to manually take each form control and set its value to an empty string. 

Or maybe to use a "setValue" method on the form and set all field to empty string.

But, there is a simple one line way.

On the form object, we have a method named "reset" which does the same.

    this.signupForm.reset()

And that's it!

And remember that this method does not only reset the values. It also resets the form states. It means, all the fields are now untouched and pristine.

And do note that we can pass an object to "reset" just like as we do in "setValue" method if we want to reset form to some default values. 

There is also another method named "resetForm()" which does the same job.
