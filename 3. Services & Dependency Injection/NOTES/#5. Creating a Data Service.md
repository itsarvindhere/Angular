We already have a logging service in our project.

One another typical use case of services in Angular is to store and manage the data.

In this way, it becomes quite easy to use that data between various components instead of having to pass the data to parent and then from parent to child and so on.

Let's create a service to handle the "Accounts" data. 

        ng g s accounts

And now, we can keep the accounts data in this service and update the data in this service itself.

And whenever we want to fetch the list of accounts or update any account or add an account, we just need to call one of the methods in the service. 

We no longer need to emit an event from the child components, then react to that event in parent component and then do something. Using a service as a data store removes all that extra logic that we had to write earlier.
